features of python:
1) simple synatx/ easy to learn
2) libraries
3) open source
4) platforn independent
5) less memory
6) faster execution compare to some programming lanuages

applications:
1) web devolopement
2) mobile app devolopement
3) machine learning/deep learning
4) ai
5) cyber security
6) graphics
7) iot
8) automation
9) deskop app devolopement ....and more

comments :
they are part of the code but they wont consider in execution time.

we have two types:
1) single line comment
                       # my 1st program
2) multi line comment
                    '''  ''' or """   """

keywords : 
they are reserved words used for particular task and they cannot be used as identifiers (variables, fun name....etc)
eg : True, False, for, if, else, while, break, try, except, finally.....etc

variable :
it is a place where we store our values
ex : a = 5
a is variable 5 is value

valid variable declaration 
a = 5
A = 7
num = 88
num1 = 66
empid = 123
emp_name = "mahesh" or 'priya'
_emp_no_ = 9876544321

invalid variable declaration 
* should not start with numbers  eg : 1n = 12
* do not use special characters  eg : w n = 1
* no space eg : stu id = 123

data type :
its pre-defined component and specify the data category

strings = str = "mahesh"
int = age = 14
float = height = 5.2

python data types
int
float
complex
str
bool

special data types (data structures)
list
tuple
set
dict

input function : input()

output function : print()

print ("hlo good morning")
hlo good morning

a = int(input("enter a number"))
enter a number 7
